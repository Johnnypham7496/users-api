# users-api
my sample flask api

1. create repository with .gitignore and license
2. create a virtual environment with 'python -m venv venv/'
3. turn on virtual environment with '. venv/Scripts/activate'
4. install flask with 'pip install flask' 
from here there should be a folder inside of the working directory with venv. To make sure the 
virtual environment is on - refer to step 3, this implies everytime you close out of terminal
5. added hello world code and run to test if the code runs
